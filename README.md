# 📊 Credit Card Analytics – Case Study Solution

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project provides a **data-driven analysis** of **credit card transactions** to help banks optimize decision-making in areas like **fraud detection, customer spending behavior, and repayment patterns**. The analysis is based on a case study of **PSPD Bank**, which operates in over 50 countries.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of:
- **Customer Acquisition** – Customer details at the time of card issuance.  
- **Spending Transactions** – Credit card purchases made by customers.  
- **Repayments** – Credit card payments by customers.  

## 📌 Key Objectives  
- **Analyze spending & repayment behavior** to identify trends.  
- **Detect fraudulent activities** and minimize chargebacks.  
- **Optimize bank profitability** using a **2.9% monthly interest rate**.  
- **Generate visual insights** on **customer spending, top products, and city-wise trends**.  
- **Develop a Python function** to find **top 10 customers** by **city, product, and time period**.  

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis & visualization  

## 📈 Insights & Impact
